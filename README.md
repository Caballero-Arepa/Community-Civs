# What is this project?

This is a community project first launched by Caballero Arepa in January 22th of 2023 with the idea to offer Unciv players the ability to create their own unique civilizations. Currently, it features 14 civilization and most of them are complete with all their unique abilities, buildings, units snd icons, but it still seeks for new contributors of the project.


# How can I create my own civilization?

You can contribute to the project creating your own civilization creating a pull request to the mod or just describing to the modders how you would shape it creating a dedicated issue and we shall provide adding it among the other ones. Still not satysfied or looking for further feedbacks?
Here's our discord server: https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/1066831737394565201.


# Which parameters should my civilization respect?

- The civilization should be based around the User (NO: Danubian empire, YES: Username's Userian empire)
- The civilization doesn't have to be OP. Most of the civs in this mod are around the A tier, we still want them to be balanced in the vanilla game.
- The rest of the community shall influence your civ, maybe in order to balance it further or maybe just for making it even more original.
- It is suggested (but not mandatory) to follow the vanilla scheme for creating new civs: give them a unique ability, a unique building, and a unique unit.
- It is whished to all the community members to have a fun time creating their civ, and it is suggested them to make a free use of all their creativity and passion in    this project. Try to make real the most bizzarre ideas that your mind suggest.
